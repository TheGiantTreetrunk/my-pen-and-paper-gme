For packaging your web application into a distributable desktop application for Windows and Linux, these are the two leading frameworks.

### **Approach 1: Electron - The Established Standard**

Electron is a powerful and mature framework for building cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). It powers many popular apps, including Visual Studio Code, Slack, and Discord. It works by bundling a full Chromium browser and the Node.js runtime with your app.

### **Approach 2: Tauri - The Modern, Lightweight Alternative**

Tauri is a newer framework designed to be much smaller and more secure than Electron. Instead of bundling a whole browser, it uses the operating system's native web-rendering engine (WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK+ on Linux). This results in significantly smaller app sizes and less memory usage.
